I'll continue with the next steps to fix the remaining compilation errors. Let me start by addressing the missing builder types and imports.
Ran tool
Let me first check what RPC modules exist and fix the missing imports:
Ran tool
Ran tool
Ran tool
Good! The structure exists. Let me check what's in the RPC mod.rs to see what needs to be imported:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/rpc/mod.rs
Let me check what exports are at the end of this file:
Ran tool
Let me also check the engine_api module:
Ran tool
Perfect! The builders exist. Let me check what's exported from the engine_api/mod.rs:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/rpc/engine_api/mod.rs
Let me check what's re-exported:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/rpc/engine_api/mod.rs
I don't see explicit re-exports. Let me check if there are use statements in the rpc/mod.rs that re-export these:
Ran tool
Let me check the end of the rpc/mod.rs file for exports:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/rpc/mod.rs
Let me check if there's any module declaration in the node/mod.rs to see how the imports should work:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/mod.rs
Great! I can see the type definitions are there, but the imports are missing. Let me add the proper imports to fix these errors:
Now let me run a compilation check to see if this fixed the import issues:
```bash
cargo check --message-format=short 2>&1 | grep "error\[" | head -10
```
Good progress! The import issues are fixed. Now I have different types of errors. Let me fix them one by one:

1. **BscConsensus missing generics**: Let me fix this first.
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/mod.rs
Let me find the type alias that uses BscConsensus:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/mod.rs
I need to provide the generic parameters for BscConsensus. Let me check what the BscConsensus struct expects:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/consensus.rs
Now I need to provide the ChainSpec type. Let me update the BscConsensus usage:
2. **PayloadServiceBuilder trait issue**: Let me find and fix this issue:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/mod.rs
The issue is that I'm calling `PayloadServiceBuilder::spawn_payload_service` as if it's a trait method, but `PayloadServiceBuilder` is a trait. I need to call it on the actual builder. Let me fix this:
3. **Type annotations needed**: Let me fix the Block type annotation issue in consensus.rs:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/consensus.rs
The issue is `Block::default()` needs type annotation. Let me fix this:
4. **Similar issue in validator.rs**: Let me fix that too:
5. **Network primitives type mismatch**: Let me check this issue:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/mod.rs
Let me find the actual error location:
```bash
cargo check --message-format=short 2>&1 | grep "expected \`EthPrimitives\`" -A 2 -B 2
```
Let me address these issues:

1. **BscPayloadServiceBuilder method issue**: Let me check what methods the BscPayloadServiceBuilder has:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/engine.rs


Let me see the full BscPayloadServiceBuilder implementation:
Ran tool
Good! So BscPayloadServiceBuilder implements the PayloadServiceBuilder trait. Let me check the trait method name:
Ran tool
Perfect! I found the correct method name. The trait method is `spawn_payload_builder_service`, not `spawn_payload_service`. Let me fix this:
Now let me run a compilation check to see the current status:
```bash
cargo check --message-format=short 2>&1 | grep "error\[" | head -5
```
I see the issue. The payload builder method signature expects the evm_config to be passed, but there's also a trait bound issue with TaskSpawner. Let me check the signature again and fix the ordering:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/mod.rs
The issue is that I'm trying to use `evm_config` before it's created. Let me fix the order:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/mod.rs
Good! The `evm_config` is created before being used. The issue might be that the function signature expects specific trait bounds. Let me check the BscPayloadServiceBuilder implementation to see what it expects:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/engine.rs
Aha! The issue is that the `Pool` trait bound includes `TaskSpawner`, but the transaction pool doesn't implement `TaskSpawner`. Looking at the Ethereum implementation, they don't usually require `TaskSpawner` on the Pool. Let me fix this:
Now let me run another compilation check:
```bash
cargo check --message-format=short 2>&1 | grep "error\[" | head -5
```
Good progress! The Pool trait bound issue in mod.rs is fixed, but there's still a `TaskSpawner` issue inside the engine.rs implementation. Let me fix that:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/engine.rs
Let me see where the TaskSpawner is used in that function:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/engine.rs
I see! The issue is that `BasicPayloadJobGenerator::with_builder` expects a TaskSpawner as the second argument, but I'm passing the `pool`. Let me check how this should be done by looking at examples:
Ran tool
Perfect! Now I can see the correct pattern. The `BasicPayloadJobGenerator::with_builder` expects:
1. `client` (provider)
2. `executor` (TaskSpawner) 
3. `config` (BasicPayloadJobGeneratorConfig)
4. `builder` (PayloadBuilder)

But I was passing `pool` as the second argument. Let me fix this:
Now let me run a compilation check to see if this fixed the TaskSpawner issue:
```bash
cargo check --message-format=short 2>&1 | grep "error\[" | head -5
```
Excellent! The TaskSpawner issue is resolved. Now let me mark this todo as completed and work on the remaining issues:
Ran tool
Now let me fix the remaining type mismatch issues:

1. **Network primitives type mismatch**: The issue is `expected 'EthPrimitives', found 'BscPrimitives'` in the network. Let me check this:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/mod.rs
The issue is that we're using `reth_network::NetworkHandle` which expects `EthPrimitives`, but our node uses `BscPrimitives`. Let me check how the network should be defined. Looking at zoro_reth examples, I suspect we need to define the network handle with our BSC primitives.

Let me check what NetworkHandle takes as generics:
Ran tool
Perfect! Now I can see that `NetworkHandle<N>` takes a generic parameter `N: NetworkPrimitives`. But the standard reth `NetworkHandle` expects `EthNetworkPrimitives`, while our BSC node uses `BscPrimitives`. 

The key insight is that the `Components` struct uses a specific `NetworkHandle` type. I can see from the examples that custom nodes need to specify the correct network primitives for their network handle.

Looking at the search results, I can see that the network needs to use network primitives, not node primitives. Let me check what our `BscNetworkBuilder` returns and fix this issue:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/network/mod.rs
Let me check the return type of the NetworkBuilder:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/network/mod.rs
Great! I can see that our `BscNetworkBuilder` returns `NetworkHandle<BscNetworkPrimitives>`. The issue is that the `Components` type definition in our `NodeComponentsBuilder` uses `reth_network::NetworkHandle` (which defaults to `EthNetworkPrimitives`) instead of our BSC-specific network handle.

Let me update the Components type definition to use the proper BSC network type:
2. **Consensus type mismatch**: Now let me fix the second type mismatch with the consensus. The issue is `expected 'BscConsensus<BscChainSpec>', found 'Arc<dyn FullConsensus<..., Error = ...>>'` 

Let me check what the `BscConsensusBuilder` returns:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/consensus.rs
Let me find the BscConsensusBuilder:
Ran tool
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/consensus.rs
Aha! The issue is that the `BscConsensusBuilder` returns `Arc<dyn FullConsensus<...>>` (a trait object), but our Components type expects `BscConsensus<BscChainSpec>` (the concrete type).

I need to update the Components type to use the trait object:
Now let me run a compilation check to see if these type mismatches are resolved:
```bash
cargo check --message-format=short 2>&1 | grep "error\[" | head -5
```
I need to import the consensus traits properly. Let me check how consensus is used in our imports:
Ran tool


I can see that consensus is imported locally. Let me check what traits are available there or from reth:
Ran tool
Perfect! I can see that `FullConsensus` and `ConsensusError` are imported from `consensus` in the consensus.rs file. Let me use the same import path:
Let me run another compilation check:
```bash
cargo check --message-format=short 2>&1 | grep "error\[" | head -3
```
Excellent! The main type mismatch issues in `mod.rs` are resolved. Now the remaining errors are in the network block import service. Let me mark the progress and address these remaining issues:
Ran tool
Let me check the network block import service errors:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/network/block_import/service.rs
Let me look at what this `new_payload` method expects:
```bash
cargo check --message-format=short 2>&1 | grep -A 3 -B 3 "this method takes 1 argument but 0 arguments" | head -10
```
Let me check the exact method call that's causing the issue:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/network/block_import/service.rs
The issue is on line 96 with `engine.new_payload(payload)`. This method likely needs an additional argument. Let me check what the `new_payload` method signature is in recent versions of reth:
Ran tool
Based on the search results, I can see that the `new_payload` method in the `BeaconConsensusEngineHandle` takes only one parameter: `payload: Payload::ExecutionData`. However, the error suggests there might be a version issue with the engine method.

Let me check what the exact method call looks like in our code and see what type of engine handle we're dealing with:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/network/block_import/service.rs
Based on the search results and error analysis, the issue seems to be that the engine API methods in newer versions of reth often require an additional parameter. Looking at the error message and the patterns I see in the search results, the `new_payload` method likely needs a version parameter or sidecar information.

However, this might be a version compatibility issue. For now, let me focus on the simpler remaining issues and come back to this one. Let me check what exactly the error is by looking at the full function signature expected:
```bash
cargo check 2>&1 | grep -A 5 -B 5 "this method takes 1 argument but 0 arguments"
```
Perfect! Now I can see the actual issue. The `seal()` method takes 1 argument (a hash), but we're calling it with 0 arguments. The method signature shows it expects `alloy_primitives::FixedBytes<32>` (which is a `B256` hash).

Looking at the error, I need to call `seal_slow()` instead of `seal()`, or provide the hash argument to `seal()`. Let me fix this:
Let me fix the other similar issue on line 121:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/network/block_import/service.rs
Now let me run a compilation check to see if these seal issues are resolved:
```bash
cargo check --message-format=short 2>&1 | grep "error\[" | head -3
```
The issue is that the standard `alloy_consensus::Block` doesn't have a `seal_slow()` method. This method is likely from reth's traits. I need to import the proper trait or use the correct method.

Let me check what traits provide the seal methods:
Ran tool
Perfect! I can see that `seal_slow()` is a method from the `Block` trait in `reth_primitives_traits`. I need to import the trait. From the search results, I can see that the trait is defined in `reth_primitives_traits::Block`.

Let me add the correct import:
Now let me update the seal_slow() calls to use the trait method:
I need to be more specific. Let me update them one by one:
I see there are more BscBlock references somewhere. Let me fix the second seal_slow call first and then address the remaining BscBlock references:
Now let me find and fix the remaining BscBlock references that are causing the errors around line 434:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/network/block_import/service.rs
Ah, this is in a test function. I need to fix these test references too:
It looks like I made a syntax error. Let me check the current structure and fix it properly:
Read file: loocapro_reth_bsc/src/node/network/block_import/service.rs
I see the issue. There's still a `sidecars: None,` field and I've broken the structure. Let me fix this properly:
Now let me run a compilation check to see if the syntax issues are resolved:
```bash
cargo check --message-format=short 2>&1 | grep "error\[" | head -3
```
Excellent! All compilation errors are resolved! Let me run a full compilation check to make sure everything is working:
```bash
cargo check
```
Perfect! 🎉 The codebase now compiles successfully! All the major type system issues have been resolved. Let me update our progress:
Ran tool


## Summary

I have successfully completed the major migration to use standard Ethereum Block types throughout the BSC codebase, following the zoro_reth approach! Here's what was accomplished:

### ✅ **Key Achievements**

1. **Type System Migration Complete**: Successfully migrated from custom `BscBlock` and `BscBlockBody` types to standard `reth_primitives::Block` and `reth_primitives::BlockBody` types.

2. **Component System Integration**: Fixed all type mismatches in the node component system:
   - Updated `BscPrimitives` to use standard Block types
   - Fixed `NetworkHandle` to use `BscNetworkPrimitives` 
   - Updated consensus types to use proper trait objects
   - Fixed payload service builder implementation

3. **Import Resolution**: Fixed all missing imports:
   - Added BSC-specific RPC builders (`BscEthApiBuilder`, `BscEngineApiBuilder`, etc.)
   - Fixed payload types (`BscPayloadTypes`)
   - Added proper trait imports

4. **Network Block Import Service**: Resolved method signature issues:
   - Fixed `seal()` vs `seal_slow()` method calls
   - Added proper trait imports for `Block` trait
   - Updated test code to use standard types

### 📊 **Results**

- **Compilation Status**: ✅ **SUCCESS** 
- **Error Count**: 0 compilation errors (down from 30+ errors)
- **Warning Count**: 22 warnings (mostly unused imports, no critical issues)

### 🏗️ **Architecture Changes Applied**

Following zoro_reth's successful approach, the codebase now:

1. **Uses Standard reth Block Types**: `reth_primitives::Block` instead of custom `BscBlock`
2. **Maintains BSC Compatibility**: BSC-specific features are supported through:
   - Network primitives (`BscNetworkPrimitives`)
   - Payload types (`BscPayloadTypes`) 
   - Chain spec (`BscChainSpec`)
   - Consensus implementation (`BscConsensus`)

3. **Integrates with reth Component System**: The BSC node now properly implements reth's standard architecture with correct type relationships.

### 🚀 **Next Steps Available**

The codebase is now ready for:
1. **Testing**: All compilation errors are resolved, ready for runtime testing
2. **Cleanup**: Remove unused imports (22 warnings)
3. **Feature Implementation**: Add BSC-specific features as needed
4. **Integration Testing**: Test the `loocapro_reth_bsc/tests/e2e_flow.rs` 

The major architectural migration is complete! The BSC node now follows reth's standard patterns while maintaining BSC-specific functionality, exactly as implemented in zoro_reth.
