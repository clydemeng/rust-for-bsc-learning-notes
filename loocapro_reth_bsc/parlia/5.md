Milestone 2 goal  
“Epoch-checkpoint handling” means: when an epoch-boundary block appears (every N = epoch_len blocks) its header contains a complete new validator list (and, after Bohr, a `turnLength` byte).  
The consensus layer must:  
1. recognise such headers,  
2. extract the new validator set + vote-addresses + optional turnLength,  
3. update the in-memory snapshot so that all later blocks are validated against the fresh rules.

How we implemented it (loocapro_reth_bsc)  

1. Helper `parse_epoch_update()` – understands the two encoding schemes  
   • pre-Luban: extraData = 32-byte vanity ‖ 20 B addr × N ‖ 65 B seal  
   • Luban/Maxwell: extraData = vanity ‖ 1 byte N ‖ (20 B consAddr ‖ 48 B voteAddr) × N ‖ [turnLength] ‖ seal  
2. In `validate_header_against_parent` we detect `header.number % snapshot.epoch_num == 0`.  
3. On an epoch block we call the parser and pass `(new_validators, vote_addrs, turn_len)` into  
   `Snapshot::apply`, which rebuilds `validators`, `validators_map`, resets proposer history, and stores the new snapshot via the provider.  
4. For non-epoch blocks we pass empty vectors so `apply` leaves the set unchanged.  
Thus header sync now auto-switches validator set & turn-length exactly at epoch checkpoints.

How zoro_reth does the same  

zoro_reth keeps the logic inside its Parlia consensus crate and the block-executor:

• Parsing helpers  
  – `Parlia::parse_validators_from_header()` and `get_turn_length_from_header()` locate the validator bytes / turnLength using the same format rules (see `crates/bsc/consensus/src/lib.rs`, functions around lines 240-300).  
• During execution ( `BscBlockExecutor::get_current_validators`, `execute.rs` ) the executor calls the consensus helpers **only when `number % epoch == 0`** to obtain the new set/turnLen, then hands them to `Snapshot::apply(...)`.  
• If the chain is before Luban it reads 20-byte addresses directly; after Luban it reads the prefixed count + vote addresses, identical to our parser.  
• Bohr detection adds the 1-byte `turnLength`.  
• Snapshots are persisted every 1 024 blocks.

So: both projects do the same three-step flow (detect epoch block → decode bytes → `Snapshot::apply`).  
The difference is only placement:  

loocapro_reth_bsc – decode & update in the header-validator (during sync).  
zoro_reth        – decode in consensus helpers, update inside the execution stage.

Functionally they match: after an epoch-boundary header both snapshots carry the fresh validator set, updated turn length, and reset proposer history ready for the next block.
