Current roadmap – outstanding work split into clear milestones
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Milestone A “Minimum-viable Parlia node”
Status: 75 % done. Header validator, in-memory snapshots and reward/slash hooks are wired and unit-tested.

Remaining A-tasks  
A1. Genesis snapshot bootstrap  
 • Parse the validator list in `chain_spec.genesis.extraData`  
 • Insert it into the `InMemorySnapshotProvider` at start-up.

A2. Snapshot persistence  
 • Finish `DbSnapshotProvider` (write path is coded; plug it into node builder).  
 • Auto-load the latest checkpoint on node restart.

A3. Body-level validation in `validate_block_pre_execution`  
 • Ommer hash, transaction root, withdrawals root, Cancun blob-gas rule, etc.

A4. Basic Engine-API handshake  
 Expose (delegated) methods:  
 `engine_exchangeCapabilities`, `engine_getClientVersionV1`, `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV2`.  
 With those the `ProduceBlocks` e2e test will pass.

A5. Turn the e2e test on  
 • Remove `#[ignore]` from `bsc_e2e_produce_blocks` and keep it green in CI.

––––– Milestone A is COMPLETE once the node can start, accept FCU/NewPayload from the test-harness, build 2 blocks, and persist snapshots.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Milestone B “Full Engine-API parity”
B1. Implement/forward all remaining Engine-API methods  
 `engine_newPayloadV3/V4`, `engine_getPayloadV3/V4`, bodies & blobs helpers.  
B2. Expose real payload building (wire our payload service & validator builders).  
B3. Capability negotiation: return the correct list depending on Cancun status.

Milestone C “Full sync & networking”
C1. Replace the dummy block-import ‘service’ with the Parlia validator + snapshot persist.  
C2. Handle reorgs (snapshot rollback) and fork-choice updates.  
C3. Long-range syncing tests (download 10 k BSC blocks in CI).

Milestone D “Production hardening”
D1. DB compaction / pruning rules updated for Parlia epochs.  
D2. Metrics and tracing spans for snapshot load/flush and header validation.  
D3. CLI flags for snapshot cache size, persist interval, hard-fork overrides.

Milestone E “CometBFT bridge (future)”
E1. Re-enable the CometBFT precompile tests on latest protobuf.  
E2. Add ABCI light-client verification to Parlia hooks.

Review these milestones; we can reprioritise or split tasks further before continuing.




-------------
I remember we have completed the "Parse the validator list " function when doing "Epoch-checkpoint handling" before.  

This time we do it again in A1.

So, what's the difference?


They solve the same sub-problem (turn the `extraData` blob into a list of 20-byte validator addresses) but at two very different moments in the node’s life-cycle.

1.  “Epoch-checkpoint handling” parser (`parse_epoch_update` in `parlia/validator.rs`)  
    • Runs while the node is already *syncing* and has a valid snapshot for the **parent** block.  
    • It must understand every fork dialect (legacy, Luban, Bohr) and also extract optional vote keys and turn-length.  
    • It is invoked only on **checkpoint headers** (the last block of an epoch).  
    • Output is fed into `Snapshot::apply` to create the *next* epoch snapshot.

2.  The new bootstrap parser added in Milestone A1 (`BscConsensus::new`)  
    • Runs exactly once, at node start-up, when there is **no snapshot at all**.  
    • Purpose: build the *very first* `Snapshot` that lets the header-validator verify block #1.  
    • Genesis `extraData` always uses the *pre-Luban* layout (a vanilla list of addresses), so the code can be much simpler and does not need Bohr/Luban branches.

Why we can’t reuse the other routine  
`parse_epoch_update` expects you to know  
 • whether the chain is already past Luban/Bohr (needs the current snapshot), and  
 • the block’s epoch boundary status.  
Those pieces of context **don’t exist before the first snapshot is created**, so we need a small, self-contained bootstrap that only understands the genesis format.

In short:  
• Bootstrap parser → one-shot, legacy-only, creates the initial snapshot.  
• Epoch parser → full-featured, runs continuously after the node has started syncing.
