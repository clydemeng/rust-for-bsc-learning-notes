Progress to-date (both repos)

1. Snapshot persistence plumbing is finished  
   • New ParliaSnapshots table, blob wrapper, (De)Compress + Encode/Decode.  
   • `DatabaseProvider::write_state()` writes blobs via a dedicated cursor.  
   • `ExecutionOutcome` extended with `snapshots: Vec<(BlockNumber, Vec<u8>)>`  
     and a helper ctor.  
   • Upstream `reth` now owns a thread-safe global `snapshot_pool`.  
     – Parlia validator pushes a CBOR-compressed snapshot into the pool
       whenever a 1 024-block checkpoint is reached.  
     – `ExecutionOutcome::from_blocks()` drains the pool and stores the
       collected pairs so `write_state()` automatically persists them.

2. Build & test status  
   • Both workspaces compile (`cargo test --no-run` OK).  
   • The previously ignored “produce two blocks” E2E test is re-enabled;
     we still need to run it end-to-end to confirm green.

3. Code hygiene / deps  
   • `once_cell 1.19` added to `reth-execution-types`.  
   • Fork depends on `reth-execution-types` to reach the pool.  
   • Parlia validator imports `Compress` to build snapshot blobs.

Where this leaves Milestone A
✓ block validation & execution path works (compiles).  
✓ snapshots are built, transported, and written to DB.  
⚠️ verification: run the two-block E2E test; inspect the DB to ensure a
snapshot blob is present at the first checkpoint boundary (block 0 or
1 024 depending on test chain config).

Remaining tasks to close Milestone A

A1. Execute the test suite (`cargo test -p loocapro_reth_bsc -- --nocapture`)
    and fix any runtime failures or panics.

A2. Add a quick integration test that
    • mines 1 024+N blocks,  
    • restarts a fresh node instance,  
    • loads the snapshot from `ParliaSnapshots`,  
    • and verifies validator‐set restoration.

A3. Documentation pass: update README / docs to describe snapshot
    mechanics, new table, and the pool.

A4. Optional (nice-to-have): remove the temporary snapshot_pool solution
    once a proper `BscBatchExecutor` (mirrors zoro-reth) is ported; it
    would make snapshot emission explicit and avoid a global mutex.

Outlook – next milestones beyond A (proposal)

Milestone B – full sync & P2P
• implement Parlia fork-choice / sync pipeline hooks.  
• bring up peer discovery & block import from mainnet/light peers.  
• verify an archive sync to latest head.

Milestone C – block production
• port BSC sealing logic (extraData, vote attestation).  
• implement Engine-API routes required by downstream consensus clients
  (ethash / clique hybrid).  
• run the “produce N blocks” test with our node as proposer.

Milestone D – ops & performance
• benchmarking, profiling, DB pruning strategies.  
• container images & CI release workflow.

You can review/adjust the milestone list, then we’ll tackle A1/A2 next.
