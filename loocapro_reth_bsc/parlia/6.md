Milestone-4: “Reward / Slashing / Gas-limit rules” – what we added

1. Gas-limit rules  
   • `consensus/parlia/gas.rs` mirrors the Go reference: the permissible gas-limit delta is  
     – parent/256 before Lorentz, parent/1024 after.  
   • Integrated into `ParliaHeaderValidator::validate_header_against_parent`.  
   • Unit-tests cover both fork regimes.

2. Proposer-quota (over-propose) slashing pipeline  
   • If the in-turn validator misses its slot (and hasn’t already exceeded quota) the header-validator now calls `slash_pool::report(spoiled_validator)`.  
   • `slash_pool` is a tiny, thread-safe in-memory buffer that accumulates evidence during header validation.

3. Executor integration  
   • `BscBlockExecutor::finish()` drains the pool, builds ABI-encoded `slash(address)` system-transactions via the new `SystemContract::slash_tx`, feeds them through the existing system-tx path, and therefore reaches the already-implemented `handle_slash_tx()` logic.  
   • The reward path (`distribute_block_rewards`) was already present; we simply preserved it.

4. Hooks scaffolding  
   • `consensus/parlia/hooks.rs` defines pre/post-execution hooks and provides reward/slash tx-helpers. (They are not yet wired in; executor still owns the logic.)

5. Tests  
   • Gas-limit tests (earlier in the session)  
   • `tests/slash_pool.rs` verifies de-duplication and draining behaviour of the pool.  
   • All 38 unit-tests pass with `cargo test`.

What’s left (Milestone-4 polish & beyond)

A. End-to-end reward/slash execution tests  
   • Build a mini-chain where a bad proposer is detected, ensure the resulting block contains the slash system-tx and the contract balance changes as expected.

B. Pre/Post-execution hooks wiring  
   • Wire `ParliaHooks` into the executor so reward/slash txs are created in the pre-execution phase instead of our current ad-hoc insertion in `finish()`.  
   • This will also allow Milestone-5 (Engine-API) to reserve gas properly for system-txs.

C. Snapshot persistence  
   • Snapshot objects are still in-memory only; persisting every `CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL` blocks to DB (and re-loading on restart) is required for production sync speed.

D. Finality-reward path  
   • `handle_finality_reward_tx()` exists but the consensus layer doesn’t yet emit that tx. Implement logic in hooks once BEP-319 height is active.

E. More evidence types  
   • So far we slash only for missed turn (over-propose). Malicious-vote or double-sign evidence handling can reuse the same pool+executor pattern.

F. Milestone-5 preview  
   • Engine-API wiring: expose `HeaderValidator`, snapshot provider, and execution hooks to the Beacon API so that downstream components (EL+CL separation) work correctly.

With these additions Milestone-4’s functional requirements are met and the groundwork for the remaining tasks (snapshot persistence, additional slashing reasons, Engine-API) is in place.
