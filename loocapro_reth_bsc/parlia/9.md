1.  What are the Engine-API and the Parlia consensus engine – why do we need them?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Engine-API  
  – A JSON-RPC interface that lets a Consensus-Layer (CL) client drive an Execution-Layer (EL) client after “The Merge”.  
  – The CL tells the EL  
    • which chain head to run on (`forkchoiceUpdated…`)  
    • what payload to build (`getPayload…`) or validate (`newPayload…`)  
    • misc. helper queries (payload bodies, blobs, version, capability negotiation).  
  – Required if you ever want a CL (Lighthouse-style, or a custom Parlia-CL) to steer Reth-BSC.  
  – Even a **solo** full-node profits: block-building is done through the same API, so tests/tools written for canonical Ethereum work unchanged.

• Parlia consensus engine  
  – BSC’s Proof-of-Staked-Authority algorithm (≈ Clique + authority-rotation).  
  – Imposes its own header rules (extraData signer‐votes, step-time, epoch resets, …) and block-selection logic.  
  – Without a Parlia consensus engine Reth can parse BSC blocks but cannot decide if they are *valid* or know who is the canonical head.

• Do other forks already have them?  
  – `zoro_reth` Yes. It contains a complete BSC node crate (`zoro_reth/crates/bsc`) with:  
    • A `BscEngineApi` wrapping the generic `EngineApi` exactly like we are writing now.  
    • A Parlia header/body validator and a payload builder.  
  – `bsc_official` (the Go-Geth code-base)   
    • Has Parlia built-in (the chain’s primary implementation).  
    • Implements the basic Engine-API methods since the Cancun hard-fork (because Go-Ethereum added them upstream).  
    • Different language, but proves the spec is sufficient for BSC.

2.  When should we modify the *local* `reth` fork?
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Only if the change is truly generic and impossible to express in `reth_bsc` itself, e.g.:

a. A trait in `reth-node-core` is too restrictive and blocks compiling a BSC-specific type.  
b. A bug in the common `EngineApi` logic that affects every chain.  
c. You want to upstream the change later and it clearly belongs in Reth.

Everything BSC-specific (Parlia rules, BSC RPC types, custom CLI flags, tests, etc.) should live under `reth_bsc/…`.  This keeps the re-merge cost with upstream Reth close to zero.

3.  Explaining the capability list
──────────────────────────────────
Every entry is a single Engine-API RPC method the EL promises to serve; the *V1/V2/V3/V4* suffixes are *fork-versions*:

• `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV1` – Paris version (Merge).  
• `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV2` – Shanghai (adds optional withdrawals).  
• `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV3` – Cancun (adds parentBeaconBlockRoot).  

• `engine_getPayloadV2` – Shanghai payload envelope = {header, transactions, withdrawals}.  
• `engine_getPayloadV3` – Cancun envelope (+ blob sidecars).  
• `engine_getPayloadV4` – Prague draft (execution requests).

• `engine_newPayloadV2`, `V3`, `V4` – counterparts for *submitting* a new built block (same fork progression).

• `engine_getPayloadBodiesByHashV1` / `ByRangeV1` – helper to fetch just tx/withdrawal bodies, Paris spec.

• `engine_getClientVersionV1` – identification handshake (EL returns its own version).

• `engine_exchangeCapabilities` – first round-trip: CL sends its supported list, EL replies with the subset it will actually serve.

Why no V1 for `getPayload`/`newPayload` in the list?  
The chain won’t ever ask for Paris *V1* payloads because Parlia never had the Paris feature-set; we only advertise the versions we really implement.

4.  Which to finish first: full Engine-API or Parlia validation?
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Recommended order:

1. Finish **Parlia header/body validation + block import**  
  • Lets Reth-BSC sync and serve blocks autonomously.  
  • Provides the logic that the Engine-API ultimately calls (`newPayload`, `forkchoiceUpdated` delegate into the validator).  
  • Much easier to unit-test in isolation.

2. Implement the **Engine-API handlers** (they mostly forward to the validator & payload-builder once those exist).  
  • Re-use `EngineApi` helper for 90 % of the logic.  
  • Fill the RPC glue (`.into_rpc_module()`) after the heavy lifting works.

So: resume Parlia work first, keep fleshing out Engine-API stubs in parallel, and turn on the full RPC module once the validator passes test-vectors.
