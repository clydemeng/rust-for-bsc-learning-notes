Current milestone context – “Milestone-4: Reward / Slashing / Gas-limit rules”

Completed so far  
• Gas-limit validation for Lorentz / Maxwell forks (with unit-tests).  
• Header-side over-propose detection + collection of slash evidence (`slash_pool`).  
• Generic `SystemTxMaker` trait and `slash_tx` constructor for on-chain logic.  
• Executor integration that:  
  – drains `slash_pool`,  
  – builds slash system-transactions,  
  – distributes block rewards.  
• Unit-tests for gas rules, snapshot over-propose detection, slash-pool.

Outstanding work items (with sub-tasks)

1. Executor <--> Hook refactor  
   1.1 Implement `ParliaHooks::on_pre_execution` call inside `BscBlockExecutor::apply_pre_execution_changes`.  
        • Reserve `reserved_gas` before running user txs.  
        • Append `system_txs` it returns (reward / slash) to the internal queue.  
   1.2 Delete/replace the ad-hoc reward & slash handling in `finish()` with the hook-driven version.  
   1.3 Add unit-test verifying that hooks are invoked and gas is reserved.

2. Snapshot checkpoint persistence  
   2.1 In `DbSnapshotProvider::insert`, persist only when  
        `block_number % CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL == 0`.  
   2.2 On node startup: if the DB has no snapshots, back-fill the latest snapshot by reading the canonical head and replaying headers until a checkpoint boundary.  
   2.3 Integration test with an in-memory MDBX stub:  
        • import > 1024 blocks,  
        • restart provider,  
        • assert the snapshot is re-loaded instead of recalculated.

3. End-to-end flow tests  
   3.1 Harness: mini-chain builder that can seal blocks with custom miner + timestamp.  
   3.2 Scenario A – in-turn proposer:  
        • mine 2 blocks, check a reward tx exists to validator.  
   3.3 Scenario B – missed slot → slash:  
        • skip in-turn validator, mine with next proposer,  
        • ensure slash tx targets `SlashContract` and original proposer’s balance decreased / slash contract balance increased.  
   3.4 Gas-limit edge cases across Lorentz & Maxwell boundaries (already unit-tested, but add e2e sanity).

4. Minor clean-ups  
   4.1 Remove `system_tx_ext::*` re-export if not needed publicly.  
   4.2 Address compiler warnings (unused imports, dead-code).  
   4.3 Doc-comments & README update for Milestone-4.

Once these bullet-points are done, Milestone-4 will be fully closed and we can proceed to Engine-API wiring (Milestone-5).
